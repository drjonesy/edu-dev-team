# Version Control with Git

## What is Version Control

Version control is a way to save multiple copies or versions of a file.

> Version control is often used by developers because they have a vast number of changes aka. different versions of their program.

## Benefits

- Make multiple copies/versions from the same file
- Load the previous content from any save point
- Compare two different versions without having save multiple physical copies
- Can be applied to either a file or folder/directory of files.
- Great way to track your changes.


## Do I Really Need It?

So why use version control? Let’s make this simple. When you’re on computer, tablet, or smart phone and you writing a paper on your favorite season, for example. You need to make sure you save your work, so it doesn’t get lost and you have to rewrite it all over again. 

Okay. That’s been around for a while. You know how save a file. 

But what if you are writing and you get to a point where you wanted a sentence or maybe paragraph that you used like seven saves ago. If you haven’t closed the paper yet, you could click the undo button until you found your content, copy the content, then use the redo button until you were back at your current version and paste in your copied content. Guess that’s not too bad! But what if you close the paper the day before. Based on the rules of saving, you can go back to the day before using just the saving method.

In version control we can go back to the beginning of the creation of the paper. When ever we save a version, it creates a copy of the file or paper and allows us to go back in history to grab content or undo from any point even if we closed the file a year ago. 


## Setup

Now unlike Google Drive and Microsoft Office 365 if we want to use version control for other programs and files, we need to install an additional free tool called git.  

### Installing Git

1.	Open a web browser and search for: `git`
2.	Find the result that lists: `git-scm.com`

> You can also just type `git-scm.com` in your browser URL field.

3.	Find the Downloads button and click it. 
4.	You should now be on the Downloads page. 

> The URL will read: `git-scm.com/downloads`

5.	Select your operating system: macOS, Windows, or Linux/Unix

## GUI (Graphical User Interface) 


## Examples

Now before we start jump into using version control on own device let’s see some common examples that exist today.

### Google Drive and Docs

    << INSERT VIDEO HERE >>

Google Drive and Docs is a perfect example of version control. Because google is full of developers they implemented this feature from the beginning. You don’t need to enable anything, it’s just available. 

### Microsoft Word and Office 365

    << INSERT VIDEO HERE >>

Your first thought might be, wait didn’t you say we could use version control with this? If this was thought, I understand the cognitive, internal, relationship you made when reading the previous content. And you would be partially correct. 

By default, Office 365 comes packaged with version control but the default way of accessing it can be difficult to use so we don’t recommend using the default option.

Instead, we recommend you use the Tracking Changes feature found in the Review menu. We recommend that for any file or document you plan to make even the smallest change that you enable Tracking Changes. 

### Multiple Files and Directories (folder)

Version Control isn't limited to one file at a time. You can actually use Version Control on a folder with many files and folder in it. There's even a feature that allows you to ignore certain files if you want.
