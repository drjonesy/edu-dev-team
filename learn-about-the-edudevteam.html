                        <p>We are a team with the goal of providing STEAM related courses for teachers and students. We are experienced in both education and technology. Our desire is provide all students with up-to-date professional industry practices, tools, and projects in a fun and engaging way.</p>
                        <p>We know from experience that the educational world is often years behind the curve on the latest technology standards and we also understand that teachers don't always have the time to prepare courses which cover the latest technology.</p>

                        <p>That's where we come in. We design the courses, make them easy to understand, and work with professional companies to make sure our content is relevant to the industry and provides real-world benefits to both student and teacher.</p>

                        <p>Our courses focus on what we call micro-courses. They are broken up into courses that can be covered within a week. Meaning they can integrate into a regular classroom and don't require a dedicated STEAM or technology class for higher grades. The micro-courses allow students to stay engaged and will provide teachers with effective feedback on the success rate and desired learning of each student.</p>
                        <p>This doesn't mean courses are limited to one week alone. We will provide additional projects and challenges for each course. This will give instructors the option to extend the course up to multiple weeks and give students more hands-on experience with the topic.</p>

                        <p>As a teaching professional we know you don't have the time to create a course for yourself. You could take your personal time to find a resource, draft up an instructional design of the course to present to your principle or district, prepare a test group, and go through the process of tweaking the course over and over until it fits your needs. By the time you'd finish all these tasks the industry would have introduced a new change and your course may no longer be relevant to the industry.</p>
